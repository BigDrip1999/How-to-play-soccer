<p>The preference dates back to the cattle industry, but culturally you can chalk it up to bigger-in-Texas palates. Argue all you like about proteins, but it's tough to convince a Texan that the other white meat packs more flavor than a well-cooked piece of beef. A brisket has two distinct portions, the leaner "flat" and the fattier point. Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts, though the definition of the cut differs internationally. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. As cattle do not have collar bones, these muscles support about 60% of the body weight of standing or moving cattle. This requires a significant amount of connective tissue, so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderise it.</p></p>

<p>Thankfully, Texas toast is getting more popular in Texas barbecue,” Vaughn says. “It’s perfect for barbecue since it can do double duty as sandwich bread and the slice of bread that comes on the side of a barbecue platter. It’s better than plain white bread because it gets wasted less often.</p>
